Create a BankAccount class that encapsulates the account balance.

The balance should be private.

Provide public methods to:

Deposit money (add to balance)

Withdraw money (subtract from balance, but only if enough balance exists)

Check the current balance

Write a program to demonstrate depositing, withdrawing, and checking balance using this class.
